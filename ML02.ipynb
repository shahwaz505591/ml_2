    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting: Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and random fluctuations rather than the underlying patterns. Consequences include poor generalization to new, unseen data, resulting in high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the test set. To mitigate overfitting, techniques like regularization, cross-validation, and reducing model complexity can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting: Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. This leads to poor performance on both the training and test sets. To mitigate underfitting, you can increase model complexity, collect more data, or choose a more suitable algorithm."

    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias: Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem, which may be complex, by a simplified model. High bias leads to underfitting, where the model is too simple and cannot capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: Variance refers to the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations or noise in the training data. High variance leads to overfitting, where the model fits the training data too closely, capturing noise and not generalizing well to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between bias and variance is inverse. As you reduce bias (e.g., by increasing model complexity), you typically increase variance, and vice versa. Balancing bias and variance is crucial for achieving good model performance. The goal is to find the right level of complexity that minimizes the overall error on unseen data."
